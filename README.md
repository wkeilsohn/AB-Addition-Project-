# AB-Addition-Project-
Python file that takes two numbers and sums them.

Project was inspired by a prompt on Rosetta Code: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/A%2BB
When run the console will prompt the user for two numbers (decimals are accepted) and will then print out the sum of those two number. 
The result of the addition is printed out in two formats; one closley matching the prompt and one that is just a standard print command.
